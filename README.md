Description: This app is an app where you can post and sell your clothes to other students at your school. You will have your own account where you can post clothing that you want to sell with a description and price, and you will be able to scroll through the clothing that other students posted and are trying to sell. Your account will be set up through your Porter's Gmail account and all payments will be made through Venmo.
